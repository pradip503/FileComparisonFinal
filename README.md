<h1> THis is a web app that tests genuineness of the assignments submitted by the students. </h1>

<h4> This application is created using different technologies:<br><br>
    1) Express.js and handlebars as view engine <br>
    2) Node.js as a middle layer <br>
    3) Python to develop API.
</h4>

<p> The application on user side allows students to submit the assignments and when the assignment is submitted it is automatically checked
with all the assignments that were previously submitted by other different users or by the same users. This is done parallely when student 
uploads the assignment. </p>

<p> Backend is developed using Python programming language. It checks the the similarity among the documents and sends back the similarity 
percentage, number of similar expressions, and the documents themselves highlighting the similar expressions. It is all done seamlessly.</p>

<p> Now, when the teacher logins, s/he can view the results direclty and can accept or reject the assignment providing some of the feedback
messages </p>
