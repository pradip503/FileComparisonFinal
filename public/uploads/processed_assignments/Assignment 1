the above description of the types of research brings to light the fact that there are two basic  approaches  to  research,  viz.,  quantitative  approach  and  the  qualitative  approach.  the  former  involves  the  generation  of  data  in  quantitative  form  which  can  be  subjected  to  rigorous  quantitative  analysis  in  a  formal  and  rigid  fashion.  this  approach  can  be  further  sub-classified  into inferential, experimental and simulation approaches to research. the purpose of inferential  approach to research is to form a data base from which to infer characteristics or relationships  of  population.  this  usually  means  survey  research  where  a  sample  of  population  is  studied  (questioned or observed).  most of  the  plagiarism detector  tools  work  on  the  same plagiarism test  principle and  basically  function very much the same as google or any other search engine works to find the matching  words  or  phrases  in  other  sources  and  provides  the  best  results,  sometimes  along  with  the  plagiarism checker percentage. to check paper for plagiarism by hand is practically impossible,  and  this  is  what  makes  any  plagiarism  software  so  powerful  for  all  the  sources  it  can  check.  nonetheless,  there  could  be  some  blind  spots  as  well;  however,  these  blind  spots  are  only  an  issue if people are not well aware of the potential blind spots or they donâ€™t know how to use a  plagiarism tool properly.
