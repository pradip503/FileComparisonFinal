it’s this article that people think could be interpreted as requiring platforms to ban memes, but more on  that  later.  the  directive  on  copyright  would  make  online  platforms  and  aggregator  sites  liable  for  copyright  infringements,  and  supposedly direct  more  revenue  from  tech  giants  towards  artists  and  journalists. currently, platforms such as youtube aren’t responsible for copyright violations, although  they  must  remove  that  content  when  directed  to  do  so  by  the  rights  holders.  proponents  of  the  directive  on  copyright  argue  that  this  means  that  people  are  listening  to,  watching  and  reading  copyrighted  material  without  the  creators  being  properly  paid  for  it. unless  the  polish  court  case  changes anything.   most of the plagiarism detector tools work on the same plagiarism test principle and basically function  very much the same as google or any other search engine works to find the matching words or phrases  in other sources and provides the best results, sometimes along with the plagiarism checker percentage.  to  check  paper  for  plagiarism  by  hand  is  practically  impossible,  and  this  is  what  makes  any  plagiarism  software  so  powerful  for  all  the  sources  it  can  check.  nonetheless,  there  could  be  some  blind  spots  as  well;  however,  these  blind  spots  are  only an  issue  if  people  are  not  well  aware  of  the  potential  blind  spots or they don’t know.
